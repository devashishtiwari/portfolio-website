A portfolio website is a curated, online space that showcases your best work. It's one of the most practical and memorable ways to share your work with press, potential collaborators or employers. Much like your PDF portfolio, a portfolio website can be used when applying for jobs or internships.

A portfolio website is a personal site where you can showcase your work, skills, and experiences to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It's a powerful tool for establishing an online presence and demonstrating your abilities in a professional manner.

Key Elements of a Portfolio Website
Homepage: This is the first impression visitors will have of you. It should be visually appealing and provide a brief introduction to who you are and what you do.

About Me/Us: A section where you provide more detailed information about yourself, your background, your skills, and your passions. This helps to build a personal connection with visitors.

Projects/Work: The core of your portfolio. Showcase your best work with detailed descriptions, images, and possibly links to live versions or repositories. Highlight the challenges, your process, and the solutions you provided.

Skills: A section listing your technical and soft skills. This can be presented as a simple list or through more creative means like infographics.

Resume/CV: An optional section where visitors can download your resume. This is especially useful for job seekers.

Blog: If you enjoy writing, a blog can be a great way to share your thoughts, insights, and updates in your field of expertise. It also helps to keep your site active and engaging.

Contact: Make it easy for visitors to get in touch with you. Provide a contact form, your email address, and links to your social media profiles.

Testimonials/References: If you have positive feedback from previous clients, employers, or colleagues, showcasing these can add credibility to your work.
